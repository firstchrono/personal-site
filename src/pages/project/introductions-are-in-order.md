Welcome! You've apparently stumbled across this website. You're probably asking yourself, “Where am I? How did I get here?”. Well, run away, run as fast as you can. This blog is the ramblings of a madman.

Still here? Well, as the great Mike Lange would say, “Get in the fast lane, Grandma, the bingo game's ready to roll!”.

I'm Jon, though, you could probably guess that based on the URL and the small text on the homepage. A DevOps Engineer by day and a normal person by night. Did you expect something else? Seriously though, I do have hobbies and interests outside of work like TTRPGs (DnD, Cyberpunk, Shadowrun), video games, 3D printing, photography, travelling, sports (hockey, football, and baseball) and apparently this blogging thing.

So, how did I get here? I didn't go through a traditional 4-year college or even a boot camp. I dropped out of college after a couple of semesters, taught myself and got a job in Customer Support, worked hard, and worked my way up the corporate ladder.

What should you expect from this blog? Honestly, I haven't the foggiest. I may post about DevOps topics (issues and resolutions, tips and tricks, news, etc.), Software Engineering topics, or even the occasional miscellaneous topic about a hobby or interest.

How often will I post, you ask? I'm not certain. Could be once a week, or once a month. It will come down to if I have a topic that I want to write about.

Now for the fun part, I don't enable trackers outside of Cloudflare insights. I'm not going to serve ads. My goal here isn't to make money. My goal is to have some fun, and write stuff down. On some posts, you may see a survey link at the bottom, if you want, fill it out. It might help me cater content or understand how you found me.

Here's an irrelevant XKCD:

Thanks for stopping by!
